# Symbolic Interactionism

Symbolic interactionism is the study of the exchange of information through symbols that takes place in social interaction.

One of the most important figures in symbolic interactionism is George Herbert Mead.

According to Mead, we develop our sense of self—our identity—through our interactions with others.

We evaluate the complex and subtle clues we observe in our interactions with others to determine what we should say, how we should act, and what we should think.

Since our interactions with others are ongoing, our sense of self is dynamic.


# Functionalism

Functionalism (or Structural Functionalism)
a theoretical perspective based on the notion that social events can best be explained in terms of the functions they perform.

manifest functions:
The functions of a type of social activity that are known to and intended by the individuals involved in the activity.

latent functions:
functional consequences that are not intended or recognized by the members of a social system in which they occur.


Both Comte and Durkheim are early functionalists.
According to functionalists, society is like the body.
Thinking of the body helps us to understand functionalism.
The body is made up of different parts such as the skeleton, musculature, organs, skin, and fluids that each carry out a different function.
The parts must work together to sustain the body.
When something wrong happens in one part, the other parts react to restore order.
It is made up of different parts, or social institutions, that serve different functions and play different roles in creating social order.
A moral compass is the foundation for social order.
Functionalism’s popularity waned in the last half century.
Some sociologists criticize functionalism for placing too much emphasis on order and too little emphasis on conflict in society.
But many of functionalism’s ideas remain useful today.
For example, Robert Merton’s distinction between the manifest and latent functions of social activities is still used by many sociologists.


# Conflict Theory

Power produces the social order by domination and and coercion.
The people who possess the most power are people with the most political, economic, and social resources.
Historically, these people have been white men.
Two types of Conflict Theory are Marxism and feminism.

# Marxism

Sociological theories that treat conflict as a normal feature of society are influenced by the writings of Karl Marx.
Many Marxist sociologists maintain a dual identity as both theorists and political reformers.
Conflict is a normal feature of society.
Individuals and groups use power to promote their interests.

Marxist sociologists study how powerful individuals and groups in society promote their interests and how those without power try to acquire it.  

Powerful individuals and groups use whatever means necessary to hold on to their power, such as through the direct use of force, the enactment of laws and rules that favor them, and almost always through the development of ideas or ideologies that justify their actions and position in society.

From the boxed definition of the text:
“Power is a pervasive element in all human relationships.”
“Many conflicts in society are struggles over power, because how much power an individual or group is able to achieve governs how far they are able to put their wishes into practice.”
Power is exerted through force, rules, laws, and ideologies.


Power and ideology are very closely connected.
Ideology is used to justify the actions of the powerful.
From the boxed definition of the text:
“Ideologies are found in all societies in which there are systematic and ingrained inequalities among groups.”
“The concept of ideology connects closely with that of power, since ideological systems serve to legitimize the power that the groups hold.”

#Feminism and Feminist Theory
feminist theory:
a sociological perspective that emphasizes the centrality of gender in analyzing the social world and particularly the uniqueness of the experience of women.
Feminism: Advocacy of the rights of women to be equal with men in all spheres of life.

Gender relations and gender inequality are central to the study of society.
Like many Marxist sociologists, many feminist sociologists see themselves as both theorists and political reformers.
Feminist sociologists argue that gender relations and gender inequality are important determinants of social interaction and social inequality.
Many feminist sociologists recognize that gender, race, and social class overlap to create complex systems of social inequality.
One of the most prominent areas of contemporary social theory is feminist theory.
From the boxed definition of the text:
“Ideologies are found in all societies in which there are systematic and ingrained inequalities among groups.”
“The concept of ideology connects closely with that of power, since ideological systems serve to legitimize the power that the groups hold.”
Feminism dates from late 18th century Europe but exists in most countries today. The intersection of gender, race, and social class in social stratification and inequality is also of primary concern.

# Rational Choice

Rational choice theorists argue that material self-interest lies at the heart of most behavior.
People behave in ways that maximize their economic interests.
Even behavior that seems irrational to others may be self-interested to the actor.
The rational choice approach in sociology has been heavily influenced by economics.
Begins with the central premise that most behavior is self-interested.
People behave in ways that maximize their economic interests.
Even behavior that seems irrational to others may be self-interested to the actor.
Many sociologists criticize rational choice theory for failing to account for many types of human behavior.

# Post-modern Theory

In postmodern theory, society is not destined to become any one thing in particular.
Rather, postmodern society is highly pluralistic, diverse, and in a constant state of flux.
Social life has no “grand narrative”
Postmodern theorists argue that there is no “grand narrative” or linear history that guides social life.
Modern social life is influenced by signs and images produced by electronic communication and mass media that create a chaotic, empty world.


# Microsociology and Macrosociology
Modern social life is influenced by signs and images produced by electronic communication and mass media that create a chaotic, empty world.
Theoretical approaches like symbolic interactionism operate on the level of face-to-face interaction.
This level of analysis is called microsociology.
Theoretical approaches like functionalism and Marxism operate on a large-scale and social systemic level of society.
This level of analysis is called macrosociology.
Macrosociologists study social institutions, political and economic systems, and broad changes like industrialization and globalization.
The strongest sociological explanations are those that try to account for social life on both micro- and macrosociological levels of analysis.
